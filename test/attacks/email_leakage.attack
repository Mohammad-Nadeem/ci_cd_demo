Feature: Checks for email addresses disclosed on our company website 'my_domain.com'. We know that hackers usually target internal email addresses and attempt to login using large password dictionaries.

Scenario: Using arachni, run the email checking module to find any addresses being disclosed from our company
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name                | value                          |
     | url                 | http://localhost:3000          |
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --modules=emails <url>
  """
  Then the output should not match /Matched string:\s+.*@my_domainds.com/
